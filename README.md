## 4. User Guide


In Magento 2, the default email server is the server installed on the webserver, which means the sender reputation for emails may be low. Low sender reputation may cause emails to be treated as untrustworthy and may be delivered to spam folders. This is undesirable for obvious reasons. Imagine your customers' reaction when important email communication like password resets, transactional emails, shipping notifications and and others are not delivered. 

**Mageplaza SMTP** will help you resolve this issue. We make several popular email providers available to configure directly in your magento admin panel. We also provide you with an easy to review log of emails that were sent, including useful details for debugging. Say goodbye to your customers' spam box forever.
